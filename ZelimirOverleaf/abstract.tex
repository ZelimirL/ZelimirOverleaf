We study radiative charge-transfer reactions and the radiative association of $Yb$ with $Ca^{+}$ in the cold-to-ultracold temperature range. Our findings confirm the validity of Langevin behavior at temperatures in the single Kelvin range. However, we also show that this behavior breaks down at ultracold temperatures, resulting in a significant isotope effect.

We explore resonant charge transfer (RCT) reactions in two-dimensions for the $ H^{+} \, H$ system. We introduce a toy model in which the collision partners are effective anyons and investigate how their introduction affects RCT rates.
