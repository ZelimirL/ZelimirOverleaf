\chapter{Conclusion}
\label{conclusion}

In this thesis, we investigated the scattering processes for particles in 2 dimensions. In Introduction we researched and discussed the application of the 2 dimensional materials, current and some possible future ones. We also discussed the applications of the 2D processes for Quantum Computing.
Following the Introduction we focused on the hydrogen molecular ion $ H_2^{+} $. We recalculated the existing result in 3 dimension. 
Then we applied the same technique to calculate the energy leves of the $ H_2^{+} $ butIn chapters 3, 4 we used the results from the chapter 2 to calculat the scattering length and Einsteing A(R) coefficients for the Radiative Quenching.

The references contain books and articles used to support the above investigation and calculation.
