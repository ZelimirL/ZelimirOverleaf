% Abstract

The goal of this thesis is twofold. First it is to present and investigate the hydrogen molecular ion in the 2 dimensions where the motivation is the applications of the 2 dimensional matherials.
The second goal is to analyze and calculate the radiative quenching cross section of the hydrogen ion molecule, in 2 dimensions.
