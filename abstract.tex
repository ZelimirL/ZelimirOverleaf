% Abstract

The goal of this thesis is twofold. First it is to present and investigate the physics of the 2 dimensions and it applications to the 2 dimensional matherials, and quantum computing.
The second goal is to use a Mathematica software to analyze and calculate the radiative quenching cross section of the hydrogen ion molecule, in 2 dimensions.
