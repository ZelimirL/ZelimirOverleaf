\chapter{Radiative Charge Transfer and Association for the $ Yb^{+} + Ca $ system}
\label{chap:RRP}
\section{Description}
The analysis of the radiative and charge transfer processes is related to the analysis of the general scattering process.
Typically, in scattering processes, we can distinguish between radiative and non-radiative processes.
We can consider these charge transfers from an energetic perspective and observe that they are endothermic or exothermic.\\
In the endothermic case, the binding energy of the electron on the ion is less than that of the atom. In this case, to satisfy the energy conservation requirement, an incoming ion must supply the additional energy. However, if the ion approaches slowly, no additional energy is supplied. So when additional energy is not available, charge transfer can only occur if the final electron binding energy is greater than or equal to its binding energy on the atom.\\
If the energy is equal, the reaction is called resonant charge transfer.\\
If not, the reaction will be processed with the possibility of the emission of a photon.
If radiation is emitted, the reaction is termed radiative charge transfer/association; if not, it is termed direct charge transfer.
\section{Radiative Charge Transfer and Association}

Radiative charge transfer (abbreviated RCT) is an inelastic, irreversible quantum collision process in which an electron is transferred and a photon is emitted.

In general the process looks like: 
$ A(n+1\prescript{1}{}S) + B \longleftrightarrow A(n\prescript{1}{}S) + B + \hbar\omega $ \\

It is governed by the dipole matrix element $ D(R) = \matrixelement{\psi_f}{r}{\psi_i} $ where $ \ket{\psi_f} $ and $ \ket{\psi_i} $ are the electronic wavefunctions associated with the initial and final states, respectively. 

In our case process is $ Yb^+ + Ca \rightarrow Ca^{+} + Yb + \gamma $, for radiative charge transfer.\\

In this reaction, the electron jumps from the upper adiabatic curve to the lower one by emitting a photon.  The nuclei continue moving while the electron radiates and drops to the lower curve, after which the electron localizes on one proton.
This is a true inelastic process, controlled by the dipole elements between initial and final states.

% The electric dipole transitions are governed by the selection rules: transitions between electronic states follow parity selection rule. Electric dipole operator is odd (Ungerade). Therefore allowed transitions must change parity: $ g \rightarrow u $. Transitions $ g \rightarrow g $ or $ u \rightarrow u $ are electric dipole forbidden (though allowed by higher multipoles or vibronic coupling).  \\
% Orbital interactions: orbitals can only mix (form nonzero overlap/hybridize) if they belong to the same symmetry species, including parity. Thus g orbitals do not mix with u orbitals.



\section{Radiative Association}

Related radiative process is Radiative association:

$ A(n+1\prescript{1}{}S) + B \longleftrightarrow A(n\prescript{1}{}S)B + \hbar\omega $ .\\

There is also emission of a photon, but as a result, a molecule is formed. In this case, a photon removes excess electronic energy and the relative kinetic energy. So in this case, from a wavefunction point of view, there is a transition from a continuum state to a bound vibrational–rotational state.

This process is dominant at very low collision energies. This is a key mechanism for molecule formation in the interstellar medium.

There are several theoretical approaches and treatments of these classes of problems. \cite{RadQuench1}, \cite{RadQuench2}, \cite{Zygelman88}.

Fairly recently, there have been advances in trapping, cooling, and manipulation of ultra-cold atoms \cite{C1CP21205B}. The development of hybrid ion-atom traps has enabled researchers to explore competing pathways, including non-radiative and radiative charge transfer, as well as radiative association, in which ions and atoms recombine and rearrange at low temperatures. 

Some possible applications include astrophysics \cite{Zygelman1}, single-ion clocks, and, more recently, quantum computing.  Ultracold atoms, cooled to nanokelvin temperatures near absolute zero $ \approx \mu K $  using laser cooling and evaporative techniques, serve as a premier platform for quantum simulation and computing. By trapping atoms in optical lattices or tweezers, they act as stable qubits for quantum information processing and simulate complex, many-body systems. 

There has been a recent \cite{C1CP21205B} laboratory study that used a hybrid trap to investigate the interactions among cold $ {^174}Yb^+ $ ions with $ {}^{40}Ca $ atoms. That study reported a large chemical reaction rate coefficient of $ 2\times 10^{-10} cm^3 s^ {-1}$ and, based on their calculations, argued that radiative charge transfer is the dominant process contributing to this rate. This is several orders of magnitude larger than similar reactions for the lighter species. The paper by\cite{ZygelmanHunt2012} repeated the calculation using the optical potential method \cite{Zygelman88} for the total of two reactions.
\begin{equation}\label{Eq1}
\begin{split}
  & Yb^+ + Ca \rightarrow Yb + Ca^+ + \hbar\omega \\[.8em]
  & Yb^+ + Ca \rightarrow YbCa^+ + \hbar\omega 
\end{split}
\end{equation}
We will show that our results are several orders of magnitude smaller than those given in \cite{C1CP21205B}. Based on these results, there are some doubts about the conclusion given in that paper concerning the role of radiative relaxation.  Following the approach in the \cite{ZL}, we apply a semi-classical approach to the system of $ YbCa $ molecules. This approach at ultra-low energies (temperatures) has not been tested before. 
In addition, we used molecular data obtained from the illustrations in \cite{C1CP21205B}. At these energies, small
details in the potential surfaces and dipole moments can be important. For these reasons, we have repeated the calculations using the original data provided in \cite{C1CP21205B}. We compare the predictions of the local-optical potential with the results obtained using the Fermi-Golden-Rule prescription \cite{Zygelman88}.
The result obtained by our calculation in the subsequent chapter is several orders of magnitude smaller than that given in \cite{C1CP21205B}. 

The local optical potential method has its roots in the semi-classical theory of radiative association first developed by Kramers and Ter-Haar \cite{KramersTerHaar1946}.  In the subsequent discussion, based on that theory, we assume that a photon is emitted with energy equal to the energy difference between the two Born-Oppenheimer potential surfaces at the transition distance. The eﬃciency of a transition is determined by an Einstein-A coeﬃcient at that internuclear distance.
This leads to the Local Optical Potential Method, and following the semi-classical approach, the total rate is estimated as a classical integral over all localized transitions.\\

In our discussion below, we briefly summarize the various theoretical approaches and use them to calculate the rates for processes.\\
We provide a rigorous upper bound for the sum of rates given in \eqref{Eq1}.

\subsection{Theory}
\label{chap:RxRP}

Here we follow the discussion in \cite{ZL}, and apply the theory to the $YbCa^{+}$ system.
The cross section of the spontaneous radiative association is given by \cite{Zygelman1}.  This can also be derived using Fermi's Golden Rule (FGR)(which was actually published by Dirac 20 years before Fermi)\cite{FermiGR}:
Considering the radiative association process:
\begin{equation}
  Yb^+ + Ca \rightarrow YbCa^+ + \hbar\omega
\end{equation}
where $\hbar\omega $ is the energy of the emitted photon. The cross-section for the radiative association process is given by:
\begin{equation}\label{eq3}
\begin{split}
  &  \sigma_{RA} = \sum_J{\sum_n{\frac{8}{3}\frac{\pi^2\omega_{nJ}^2}{c^3k^2} \left[(J+1)M_{J+1,J}^2(k,k')+J\,M_{J-1,J}^2(k,k')\right]}} \\[.8em]
  & M_{J,J'}(k,n) = \int_{0}^{\infty}{dR\,f_J(kR)D(R)\phi_{J'n}(R) }
\end{split}
\end{equation}
where $ D(R) $ is the transition dipole moment  between $ X^2\Sigma^{+} $  and $ A^2\Sigma^{+} $ states of the $ YbCa^+  $ molecular ion. $ \phi_{J'n}(R) $ is a rho-vibrational eigenstate of the $ X^2\Sigma^{+} $ ground state, with energy eigenvalue $ \epsilon_{nJ} $. The $ J $ and $ n $ represent the angular and vibrational momentum quantum numbers, respectively. $ f_J(kR) $ is s the wavefunction that satisfies the
radial Schrodinger equation
\begin{equation}\label{eq4}
  f_{J}''(kR) - \frac{J(J+1)}{R^2}f_J(kR) + 2\mu V_{A}(R))f_{J}(kR) + k^2 f_{J}(kR) = 0
\end{equation}
where $ V_{A}(R) $ is the Born-Openheimer energy of the excited $ A^2\Sigma^{+} $ state, $ \mu $ is the reduced mass of the collision system, and $ k $ is the wavenumber of the incident collision partners in that channel.
The asymptotic solution of the $ f_J(kR) $ has the form:
\begin{equation}\label{fjRZ}
f_{J}(kR) \longleftarrow \sqrt{\frac{2\mu}{\pi k}}\sin(kR - \frac{J\pi}{2} + \delta_J)
\end{equation}
where $ \delta_J $ is a phaseshift, as $ R \rightarrow \infty $.
The energy of the emitted photon is given by
\begin{equation}
\hbar\omega = \frac{\hbar k^2}{2\mu} + V_A(\infty) - \epsilon_{nJ} - V_X(\infty) 
\end{equation}

This process is governed by the selection rules, 
\begin{itemize}
\item Rotational: $ \Delta J = \pm 1 $
\item Electric Dipole: $ \mel{f}{D}{i} $ 
%\item Parity: $ g \leftrightarrow u $
\item Electronic angular momentum: $ \Delta \Lambda = 0, \pm 1 $
  \begin{itemize}
    \item where $ \Lambda = 0,1,2 $ corresponds to $ \Sigma, \Pi, \Delta $ states
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\begin{figure}[H]

  \caption{Illustration of the BO molecular potential curves (solid thick lines) participating in the radiative association process. In the $ A^2\Sigma^+ $ entrance channel, the wave function is shown by the light undulating line. The oscillations are due to the strong polarization force in the entrance channel, leading to a potential minimum at $ R \approx 14a_0 $.  Association is precipitated by the emission of a photon of energy $ \omega $ near the classical turning point. The final bound rho-vibrational state, in the $ X^2\Sigma^+ $ channel, is shown by the thin line.}

\section{Radiative Charge Transfer theory}
\label{chap:RxCP}

Here, we consider the radiative charge transfer process
\begin{equation}
  Yb^+ + Ca = Yb + Ca^+ \hbar\omega
\end{equation}
where $ \hbar\omega $ is the energy of the emitted photon given by the expression \eqref{hbaromega2}.
The cross-section for the radiative charge transfer process is given by
\begin{equation}\label{sumZZ}
\begin{split}
& \sigma_{CT} = \int_0^{\omega_max}{d\omega\,\frac{d\sigma}{d\omega}},\\[.8em]
& \frac{d\sigma}{d\omega} = \sum_J{\frac{8}{3}\frac{\pi^2\omega_{nJ}^3}{c^3k^2}\left[(J+1)M_{J+1,J}^2(k,k')+J\,M_{J-1,J}^2(k,k')\right] }
\end{split}
\end{equation}
where
\begin{equation}\label{mjjz}
  M_{J,J'}(k,n) = \int_{0}^{\infty}{dR\,f_J(kR)D(R)f_J'(k'R }
\end{equation}
Here $ f_J(kR) $ is a solution to \eqref{eq4} and $ f_J^{'}(k^{'}R) $ obeys the corresponding equation for the $ X^2\Sigma^+ $ exit channel with wavenumber and partial wave $ k' $, $ J'$ respectively.
The radial wavefunctions are normalized as in \eqref{fjRZ} and
\begin{equation}\label{hbaromega2}
\begin{split}
  & \hbar\omega = \frac{\hbar k^2}{2\mu} - \frac{\hbar k^{'2}}{2\mu} + \Delta E \\[.8em]
  & \Delta E = V_A(\infty) - V_X(\infty)
\end{split}
\end{equation}
From the \eqref{hbaromega2} the maximum angular frequency $ \omega_max $ is
\begin{equation}
\hbar\omega_{max} = \frac{\hbar k^2}{2\mu} +  \Delta E
\end{equation}
We avoid evaluating the sum \eqref{sumZZ}. \\

Instead, we will compute an upper bound on the charge transfer cross section.
From the equation abov,e we get for the frequency of the emitted photon, during an RCT transition, to be
\begin{equation}
\hbar\omega = \frac{\hbar k^2}{2\mu} - \frac{\hbar k^{'2}}{2\mu} + V_A(\infty) - V_X(\infty) = \frac{\hbar k^2}{2\mu} - E' + V_A(\infty) - V_X(\infty)
\end{equation}
Now, from the equation above, we can see that to achieve the maximum energy of the emitted photon, $ \hbar\omega_{max} $, we need to have $ E' = 0 $.
The maximum value of $ E' $ is achieved when $ \hbar\omega = 0 $ therefore:
\begin{equation}
  E_max^{'} = \frac{\hbar k^2}{2\mu} + V_A(\infty) - V_X(\infty)
\end{equation}
Now the \eqref{sumZZ} can be written as:
\begin{equation}
  \sigma = \frac{8}{3}\frac{\pi^2}{c^3k^2}\int_0^{E_{max}^{'}}{dE'\,\omega^3(E')\left[(J+1)M_{J,J+1}^2(k,E')+J\,M_{J,J-1}^2(k,E')\right]}
\end{equation}
where we have the inequality
\begin{equation}\label{sigmalessthan}
  \sigma_{CT} < \frac{8}{3}\frac{\pi^2\omega^3(E')_{max}}{c^3k^2}\int_0^{E_{max}^{'}}{dE'\,\left[(J+1)M_{J,J+1}^2(k,E')+J\,M_{J,J-1}^2(k,E')\right]}
\end{equation}
Now we can replace the expression for $ M_{J+1,J}^2(k,E') $ in \eqref{sigmalessthan} with the expression in \eqref{mjjz} and squaring it,  we get the integral
\begin{equation}
  \int_0^{\infty}{dE'\,JM_{J,J-1}^2(k,E')} = \int_0^{\infty}{dE'\int_{0}^{\infty}{dR\,f_J(kR)D(R)f_{J-1}(k'R}\int_{0}^{\infty}{dR'\,f_J(kR')D(R)f_{J-1}(k'R' }   }
\end{equation}
so the inequality becomes
\begin{equation}
  \int_0^{\infty}{dE'\,JM_{J,J-1}^2(k,E')} < \sum_{E'}{JM_{J,J-1}^2(k,E')} = J\int_{0}^{\infty}{dR\,f_J^2(kR)D^2(R)}
\end{equation}
and we get for the upper bound
\begin{equation}\label{sigmaUpper}
  \sigma_{CT} < \tilde{\sigma}_{CT}\frac{8}{3}\frac{\pi^2\omega^3(E')_{max}}{c^3k^2}\sum_{J}{(2J+1)\int_{0}^{\infty}{dR\,f_J^2(kR)D^2(R)}}
\end{equation}

\subsection{Optical Potential Approach}

The alternative way to compute the cross section is to use the local optical potential method \cite{Zygelman88}.  The loss of flux from the entrance channel equals the radiative probability, which is converted to a radiative cross section.
In this method, the collision system in the incoming $ A^2\Sigma^{+} $ state experiences an imaginary (absorptive) potential $ iA(R)/2 $ added to the entrance-channel BO potential.
So we define a complex potential 
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
  & V(R) = V_{BO}(R) + V_{OPT}(R) = V_{BO}(R) + i\frac{A(R)}{2} \\[.8em]
  & A(R) = \frac{4}{3c^2}D^(R)[V_A(R) - V_X(R)]
\end{split}
\end{equation}
$ A(R) $ is the Einstein-A coefficient. We shall use a 2D version of the optical theorem to compute the radiative charge transfer in the 2D case in the next chapter.
The next step is to solve the usual radial scattering equation, but with $ V(R) $ complex. The resulting S matrix becomes non-unitary, $ |S| < 1 $, and the “missing probability” is the radiative loss.

The cross-section for radiative quenching is given by
\begin{equation}\label{quenchR}
  \sigma = \frac{\pi}{k^2}\sum_J{(2J+1)(1 - e^{-4\eta_j)}}
\end{equation}

where $ \eta_j $ is the imaginary part of the J'th partial wave phase shift $\delta_j $ for the radial wave $ f_J(kR) $ that satisfies
\begin{equation}\label{PartW3D}
  f_J^{''}(kR) - \frac{J(J+1)}{R^2}f_J(kR) + 2\mu (V_A(R) + V_{opt}(R))f_J(kR) + k^2f_J(kR) = 0
\end{equation}

The Local Optical Potential is generally applicable when the following conditions are satisfied, which aligns well with our case.
\begin{itemize}
  \item Transition happens over a region small compared to relevant wavelengths
  \item Emission is relatively weak compared to the collision energies
  \item It is accurate enough for the computation of total probability
\end{itemize}

\subsection {Ultra Cold Limit}

In the limit of ultracold temperatures, only the s-wave state participates in the process, so the total cross section takes a simpler form.
\begin{equation}\label{coldInt}
  \sigma = \sum_{n}{\frac{16\mu \pi \omega_n^3}{3 c^3 k}\left|\int_0^{R_0}{dR\,\phi(R)D(R)\phi_{J=1}^{n}(R)} \right|^2 }
\end{equation}

where $ \phi(R) $ is the s-wave solution to \eqref{eq4}. 
The boundary condition for $ \phi(R) $
\begin{equation}
\frac{d\phi(R)}{dR}|_{R_0} = 1
\end{equation}
is valid for a sufficiently large radius $ R $ and $ \phi_{J=1}^{n}(R) $ are $ J = 0 $ rho-vibrational states of the $ X^2\Sigma^+ $ potential.
Because there is only an s-wave, the integral \eqref{coldInt} does not depend on the incoming wave number $ k $. Therefore, the equation \eqref{coldInt} predicts that the association cross section, in the ultra cold regime, scales as the inverse of the incoming velocity, i.e., the rate tends to a constant.

We shall show in the subsequent chapter the method used to compute the phase shift. The idea is to match the numerical solution for $f_J(kR)$ to its asymptotic form for large $R$.

\begin{figure}[H]

  \caption{R-dependent Einstein A coefficient as a function of internuclear distance}
\end{figure}

\section{Results}

Figure \ref{RadAssoc4} illustrates the mechanism for radiative association for the $ Yb^+ $ ion and $ Ca $ atom that approach in the $ A^+\Sigma^2 $  electronic BO state. The BO energies were taken from the data of the ab-initio calculations reported in \cite{Ref4}. At large internuclear distances, this potential has the form
\begin{equation}
  V_A(R) \rightarrow \frac{C_4^A}{R^4}\,\,\,\,\,C_4^A = 78.5
\end{equation}

In the case of Radiative association, the incident $A^2\Sigma^+$ channel can relax via photon emission. In that case, the final state is a bound rho-vibrational level of the $ X^2\Sigma^+ $  channel.  In radiative charge transfer, the collision partners can exit in that channel, as a re-arranged $ Yb - Ca^+ $  pair. In the exit channel
\begin{equation}
  V_X(R) \rightarrow \frac{C_4^X}{R^4} + \Delta E\,\,\,\,\, C_4^X = 71.5\,\,\,\,\, \Delta E = -0.0052
\end{equation}
as $ R \rightarrow \infty $ \\
In calculating the radiative association cross sections given by \eqref{eq3}, we need to itemize all bound
states supported by the $ X^2\Sigma^+ $ channel. The total number of bound states can be approximated using the JWKB expression
\begin{equation}
  n = \text{Floor}\left[\int_{R_c}^{\infty}{dR\,\sqrt{-2\mu (V_X(R) - \Delta E)} - 1/2}\right] \approx 54,878
\end{equation}
where $ R_c $ is a classical turning point Floor[x] is the integer lower bound of $ x $.\\
Here we have a large reduced mass $ \mu $, i.e., the participant's mass is large, which in turn produces a very large number of bound states. For lighter participants, the number of rho-vibrational states is typically in the order of a few hundred \cite{Zygelman1}.\\
Here we have another factor to consider. In the ultra-cold temperatures, the participants have lower energies, so the centrifugal repulsion in the entrance channel limits the number of partial waves that participate. Since the selection rules $J \pm 1$ still apply, they constrain the possible rho-vibrational levels. For example, at a collision energy corresponding to a temperature of $ 1 mK $, only levels with $ J $ up to the value $ \approx 15 $ contribute to the association rate.\\

The following graph \ref{compFig3} shows the results of the calculation.

\begin{figure}[H]
  \includegraphics[width=1.0\textwidth]{ResultsYbCa}
  \caption{Plot of various cross sections as a function of incoming partial wave $ J $. Circles represent data for the radiative association cross sections, X’s represent an upper bound for the total (association + radiative charge transfer), and squares represent the data for the total radiative relaxation obtained using the optical potential method.}
  \label{compFig3}
\end{figure}

We have made the calculations two ways. First, starting from the equation \eqref{eq4}, we computed the cross section using equation \eqref{sumZZ}. In the figure \ref{compFig3} symbol $ X $ represents the upper limit for total radiative relaxation, which is obtained by adding the association cross sections \eqref{sumZZ} with those given by expression \eqref{sigmaUpper}.\\
The square icons represent the cross sections predicted by expression \eqref{quenchR},i.e., by the optical potential method.\\
So from figure \ref{compFig3} for values $ J < 10 $ we see that an optical potential method provides a very good approximation to the total cross section.\\
However, this approximation is good only for values $ J < J_{max} $ \cite{ZygelmanHunt2012}.
\begin{equation}
  J_{max} = \sqrt[4]{8\mu k^3 C_4^A} = \sqrt[4]{24 \mu^2 k_B T C_4^A} \approx 12
\end{equation}
The collision energy of the collision system is given as $ 3/2 k_B\, T $ where $ k_B $ is the Boltzman constant and $ T $ is the temperature in Kelvin \\
Value $ J_{max} $ is the critical angular momentum for which the collision system has sufficient collision energy to overcome the centrifugal potential barrier \cite{ZygelmanHunt2012}. For larger J, tunneling resonances can access the inner region where the transition dipole moment is non-negligible and induce radiative transitions.

In Table I of \cte{ZL}, we present the various cross sections at several representative collision temperatures. The second column contains the association cross-section obtained using the FGR method described above. For the radiative charge-transfer cross sections, as listed in the third column, we used \eqref{sigmaUpper}. Thus, the upper bound for the total radiative relaxation cross sections is given in column 4. The last column gives the results obtained using the local optical potential method. The table shows that, over the temperature range considered, the local optical potential method predicts cross sections that are less than the upper bound itemized in column 4. Secondly, the differences between the two theories' predictions are small. The optical potential cross section differs by less than 4\%  from the upper limit values over the entire temperature range, including the ultra-cold region.\\
One can also note that the optical potential method predicts cross sections that are larger than the radiative association cross sections. At the same time the optical potential method provides a reliable upper bound for the total (RR) cross section.\\

In Figure we plot the total radiative relaxation cross section, obtained using the optical potential method, for the gas temperature range $ 1 mK < T < 1K$.

\begin{figure}[H]
  \includegraphics[width=1.0\textwidth]{CrossSection3D}
  \caption{Total radiative relaxation cross section as a function of collision energy expressed as $ E = 3/2\,k_B T $, where T is the temperature in Kelvin}
  \label{Fig4}
\end{figure}

Although the optical potential method provides a good approximation for the total radiative relaxation rate, calculation of the photon emission spectrum requires the use of the FGR method. use of the FGR method. In \ref{Fig5} we illustrate the association cross sections $ \sigma_{n\,J} $ at $ T = 1mK $ for the individual rho-vibrational levels as a function of the frequency of the emitted photon. The structure of the emission pattern is the result of the oscillation in the incoming wave as shown in \ref{RadAssoc4}

\begin{figure}[H]
  \includegraphics[width=1.0\textwidth]{Spectrum3D}
  \caption{mission spectrum for the radiative association process at a gas temperature of 1mK.}
  \label{Fig5}
\end{figure}

In the limit $ T \rightarrow 0 $, we define a complex scattering length for the s--wave solution to \eqref{PartW3D}
\begin{equation}
  a \equiv - \frac{1}{k}\tan \delta(k) = 10785 - i0.008842;\,\,\,\,\text{as}\,\,\,k \rightarrow 0
\end{equation}
Therefore, the total RR cross section, according to the optical potential method, has the limiting value
\begin{equation}
  \sigma = \frac{4\pi}{k} 8.842 \times 10^{-3}  
\end{equation}
Defining the rate coefficient 
\begin{equation}
  k_{RR} \equiv \langle \nu \sigma \rangle
\end{equation}
we use the results from \cite{ZL} to show the values of $ k_{RR} \approx 1.15 \times 10^{-14} $.\\
By looking at \ref{Fig4} we observe that $ k_{RR} $ varies slow, from $ 1.6 \times 10^{-15}cm^3 s^{-1} $ at 1mK to $ 2 \times 10^{-15} cm^3 s^{-1} $ at 1K.

We can summarize the current chapter as follows. Using both quantum and semi-classical methodologies, we calculated the rates for the radiative association and charge transfer in cold collisions of $ Yb^+ $ with $ Ca $. We have shown that the optical potential method provides very good results in predictions for the total radiative relaxation rates, in the ultra-cold s-wave scattering regime
In addition, we have computed and shown the cross section $ \sigma $ as a function of temperature $ K $ and frequency of the emitted photons.

\subsection{Isotope Dependency}

Different Yb isotopes $ ({}^{170}Yb, {}^{174}Yb, {}^{176}Yb) $ differ only in nuclear mass, not in electronic structure. Thus, isotope dependence arises from nuclear motion. Following \cite{ZygEtAll4} we observe that radiative processes $ Yb^+ + Ca \rightarrow Yb + Ca^+ + \hbar\omega $ and $ Yb^+ + Ca \rightarrow YbCa^+ + \hbar\omega $ are both controlled by the overlap integral
\begin{equation}
  \int_0^{R_0}{dR\,\phi(R)D(R)\phi_{J=1}^{n}(R)}
\end{equation}
Because isotope mass shifts the bound-state energies, it leads to order-of-magnitude differences in rate constants between isotopes.\\
At ultralow temperatures ($ \mu K $K and below), only the s-wave is present, and the rates obey the Wigner threshold law. In that case, if a $Yb$ isotope supports a bound state just below threshold, the scattering length becomes very large, and the radiative association rate is strongly enhanced. The enhancement becomes isotope-specific. This explains the pronounced isotope separation seen in calculated rate curves as shown in \cite{ZygEtAll4}.
So, radiative association shows strong isotope dependence, while the radiative charge transfer isotope dependence is smaller. {\Large \it Include diagram in published paper which shows isotope effect}

In the following sections, we focus on 2D systems and describe Resonant Charge Transfer. Something we will calculate in the following sections.
