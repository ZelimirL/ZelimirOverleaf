% Thanks

First I would like to thank my supervisor, Dr. Bernard Zygelman, for all his help and advice.

Thanks to the usual suspects, my parents for their help. Big thanks goes to my family who kept me busy. As they say if you want something done, give it to someone who is already busy.

I would also like to thank all my friends, who asked questions about this thesis and made me guilty for not completing it on time.
