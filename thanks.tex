% Thanks

First I would like to thank my supervisor, Dr. Bernard Zygelman, for all his help and advice.

Thanks to the usual suspects, my parents and my sister, for their help.

I would also like to thank all my friends, who asked questions about this thesis and made me guilty for not completing it on time.
