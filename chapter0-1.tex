\chapter{2D Systems}
\label{chap:2DS}

After the introduction in the previous chapters, we will now start focusing on the 2 dimensional system, namely hydrogen molecular ion. We shall examine the  radiative processes in 2 dimensions. The discussion from the previous chapter applies here. 
We repeat that we consider the atoms and molecules confined in 2 dimensions while the radiation is in 3 dimensions. We feel that this could address a real physical setup. In the introduction we showed that there are effectively 2 dimensional materials.\\

As far as this author knows, in the literature there are no molecular data for the 2D systems. In this chapter we shall approximate the potential curves using LCAO method. The idea is to obtain some approximate insight of the general shape of the potential curves. 


\subsection{Approximation}

Here we briefly derive the approximate solution, in order to get a 'feel' of what we are looking into.  We want the show the molecular potential of the $ H_2^+ $ ion.
We use the LCAO method and examine the Gerade and Ungerade potentials.

\section{Gerade and Ungerade Molecular Potentials}
In diatomic molecules terms Gerade (German for even) and Ungerade (German for odd)describe how the electronic wavefunction behaves under inversion symmetry, i.e. symmetry of the molecular orbital with respect to the inversion center.
If the place the internuclear axis passing through the center of the molecule, the inversion manifests with every coordinate point $ r $ with $ -r $ .
These terms re meaningful only for molecules or systems that possess a center of inversion, points such that $ r\,\rightarrow -r $ maps the molecule onto itself.
The definition:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Gerade(g): an orbital wavefunction $ \Psi(r) $ is gerade if it is unchanged by inversion: $ \Psi(-r) = \Psi(r) $. It has even parity. Example: $ 1s\sigma_g $

  \item Ungerade(u): an orbital wavefunction $ \Psi(r) $ is ungerade if it changes sign under inversion: $ \Psi(-r) = -\Psi(r)  $. It has odd parity. Example $ 2p\sigma_u $.
\end{itemize}

\section{Selection rules and consequences}
Electric dipole transitions: transitions between electronic states follow parity selection rule. Electric dipole operator is odd (Ungerade). Therefore allowed transitions must change parity: $ g \rightarrow u $. Transitions $ g \rightarrow g $ or $ u \rightarrow u $ are electric dipole forbidden (though allowed by higher multipoles or vibronic coupling).
\\
Orbital interactions: orbitals can only mix (form nonzero overlap/hybridize) if they belong to the same symmetry species, including parity. Thus g orbitals do not mix with u orbitals.


\section{LCAO}
The ground state expression gives amplitude for the 2-dimensional hydrogen atom \cite{YangXL}
\begin{equation}
\psi_{1s}({\bf r}) =\frac{4}{\sqrt{2 \pi}}e^{-2 \, r}
\end{equation}
where $ r = |{\bf r}|$. In the LCAO method, an approximate description of the 2D gerade molecule $H_{2} $, for internuclear separation ${\bf R}$ is given by
\begin{equation}
\psi_{g}({\bf r},{\bf R}) = C(R) \Bigl ( \psi_{1s}({\bf r}-{\bf R}/2 ) + \psi_{1s}({\bf r}+{\bf R}/2 ) \Bigr )
\end{equation}
where $C(R)$ is a normalization factor so that
\begin{equation}
\int d^2 {\bf r} \, |\psi_{g}({\bf r},{\bf R})|^2 = C^2(R) \Bigl (
2 + 2 \int d^2 {\bf r} \, \psi_{1s}({\bf r}) \psi_{1s}({\bf r}+{\bf R}) \Bigr ) =1
\end{equation}
or,
\begin{equation}
  C(R) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2 (1+ S(R) )}} \text{   and} \quad S(R) \equiv \int d^2 {\bf r} \, \psi_{1s}({\bf r}) \psi_{1s}({\bf r}+{\bf R}) \label{eq:soverlap}
\end{equation}
We now evaluate the expectation values $ \langle V \rangle $ of
the potential
\begin{equation}
-\frac{1}{|{\bf r} - {\bf R}/2|} - \frac{1}{|{\bf r} + {\bf R}/2|}.
\end{equation}
Inserting the above wave amplitude to evaluate the expectation value, we get
\begin{equation}
\langle V \rangle_{g} =
-2 \int \frac{d^2 {\bf r}}{r} \, |\psi_{g}({\bf r}+{\bf R}/2 )|^2.
\end{equation}
We use the virial theorem to estimate the gerade ground state expectation value for the kinetic energy operator
\begin{equation}
\langle KE \rangle_{g} = \frac{1}{2} \langle {\bf r} \cdot {\bf \nabla} V \rangle
\end{equation}
and since

\begin{equation}
{\bf r} \cdot {\bf \nabla} V  = {\bf r}\cdot \frac{( {\bf r}- {\bf R}/2) }{ |{\bf r}- {\bf R}/2 |^{3} } + {\bf r}\cdot \frac{( {\bf r}+ {\bf R}/2) }{ |{\bf r}+ {\bf R}/2 |^{3} }
\end{equation}
we find
\begin{equation}
\langle KE \rangle_{g} =
 \int \frac{d^2 {\bf r}}{r} \, |\psi_{g}({\bf r}+{\bf R}/2 )|^2
+ \int \frac{d^2 {\bf r}}{r^3} \, ({\bf r}\cdot{\bf R}/2) \,
|\psi_{g}({\bf r}+{\bf R}/2 )|^2 .
\end{equation}
In the same manner, we obtain the BO energy for the ungerade BO state,
\begin{equation}
\psi_{u}({\bf r},{\bf R}) =\frac{1}{\sqrt{2 (1- S(R) )}}\int d^2 {\bf r} \, \Bigl ( \psi_{1s}({\bf r}-{\bf R}/2 ) - \psi_{1s}({\bf r}+{\bf R}/2 ) \Bigr ).
\end{equation}

In Table \ref{tab:lcaotabG} we show the accurate vs LCAO values for the gerade state.

Graphical comparison of the accurate vs LCAO potential for the gerade state. The accurate potential is in Red and the approximation is in blue.

This can be easier observed in the enhanced plot.

\includegraphics{"Vg-Vs-LCAO-2"}

Above graphs shows accurate gerade potentials (red dots), versus the ones obtained with the simplistic LCAO method described above.
We can observe that for $ R > 10 $ there is fair agreement; not so good for $ R < 10 $. This is a reasonable result as the LCAO including only the ground state orbital is a poor description in the molecular region.

We now show the same comparison for the ungerade state in Table \ref{tab:lcaotabU} we show the accurate vs LCAO values for the ungerade state.

graphical comparison of the accurate vs LCAO potential for the ungerade state.

\includegraphics{"Vu-Vs-LCAO-good"}

Unlike for the gerade state, in the ungerade case the LCAO is quite a good approximation to the accurate potential. \\
The reason is the symmetries of the gerade and ungerade states and the overlap integral \eqref{eq:soverlap}.
In the ungerade case we have:\\
$ \psi_{u}({\bf r},{\bf R}) \approx  \psi_{1s}({\bf r}-{\bf R}/2 ) - \psi_{1s}({\bf r}+{\bf R}/2 ) $ which makes $ 1 - S \approx 1 $.\\
It follows that the orbital are close to being orthogonal, which makes LCAO approximation more accurate.\\

In the gerade case, we have $ \psi_{g}({\bf r},{\bf R}) \approx  \psi_{1s}({\bf r}+{\bf R}/2 ) - \psi_{1s}({\bf r}+{\bf R}/2 ) $. In this case we have $ 1 + S > S $. In this case the LCAO orbits are much less orthogonal, so the overlap error becomes much greater.

In the following figures we show the atomic orbitals for the gerade and ungerade case as a function of the internuclear distance R.

\section{Resonant Charge Transfer}

In the Resonant Charge Transfer, the electron tunnels through the molecular barrier between two protons. There is no emission of the photon. Since no energy is lost, $ E_{initial} = E_{final} $ the process is elastic.

The process is $ H^+ + H \rightarrow H + H^+ $.

Because the two protons are identical, the molecular ion, $ H_2^+ $ in our case,  has two adiabatic electronic states:
\begin{itemize}
  \item{gerade $ g $}
  \item{ungerade $ u $ }
\end{itemize}

During the collision, the nuclear motion accumulates different phase shifts on the gerade and ungerade potentials.
When the nuclei separate again, the superposition is no longer symmetric, so the electron localizes on either nucleus with some probability.\\
This produces charge exchange without radiation, and the process is controlled by the phase shift difference between the gerade and ungerade states.

Here we shall investigate the low energy collision process between the hydrogen atom and the hydrogen ion, in 2 dimension. We use fully quantum mechanical approach to calculate the cross section and the emission spectra of the reaction $ H(2\prescript{2}{}S) + H(1\prescript{1}{}S)\rightarrow H(1\prescript{1}{}S) + H(1\prescript{1}{}S) + \hbar\omega $, formed by the quenching of the excited $ H $ atom by the approaching $ H $ atom, in 2D dimensions. To my knowledge, there is no experimental results related to the 2D problem. There are results for the 3D case, listed in \cite{Zygelman88} and references there.

In this calculation, the atoms are confined in 2 dimensions, while the radiation is emitted or absorbed in all 3D space. Therefore the photon can be emitted in any direction and the potential felt by the incoming ion is the standard 3D Coulomb potential.

We will model this as a scattering problem, using a Born-Oppenheimer approximation and optical theorem. The Hamiltonian in this case will contain another term, namely the interaction of the radiation field with the electron

While the problem has not been solved analytically, we will show that it can be solved numerically, to a desired precision. The radiative processes are driven by the interaction of the collision system with the radiation field. The direct change transfer is due to the transition between atomic (molecular) states due to the nuclear motion. Because the collision energy considered is low, typically only molecular states included are those which correspond to the initial $ A \prescript{1}{}\Sigma^+ $  and final $ X \prescript{1}{}\Sigma^+ $ channels.

We shall investigate the low temperature collision process between the hydrogen atom and the hydrogen ion, in 2 dimension. We use fully quantum mechanical approach to calculate the cross section and the emission spectra of the reaction $ H(2\prescript{2}{}S) + H(1\prescript{1}{}S)\rightarrow H(1\prescript{1}{}S) + H(1\prescript{1}{}S) + \hbar\omega $, formed by the quenching of the excited $ H $ atom by the approaching $ H $ atom, in 2D dimensions.

From now on  we shall start with the calculation. We shall replicate the existing results, but try a new method.
